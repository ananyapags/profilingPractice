# CUDA Profiling Practice

This repository contains my ongoing work while learning CUDA and getting more comfortable with compiling, running, and profiling GPU code .

I’m using this repo as a working space to experiment with small CUDA examples, build systems, and profiling workflows. It’s meant to track what I’m learning rather than serve as a finished or polished project.
